    <TabItem value="strat1" label="RS 4 vs. M3 E92">
This battle works with either car. The RS4 is easier to spin out, but the M3 E92 is unstable during collisions for the player. BMW has better acceleration.

First round: Wait ~2s on the line with RS4 or ~2.5s with M3, then go after your opponent. Build speed to <span class="tooltip">130-160 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">80-100 mph</span></span> and pit your opponent without losing control and outrun them. Cut or ignore the slow corner if needed. Your backup is spinning or slamming your opponent at the slow corner.

Second round: Get up to <span class="tooltip">130-160 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">80-100 mph</span></span> alongside your opponent (do NOT overtake) and pit them. Mostly the same as the first round. BMW only risky strat: With a quick launch, you can pit the Audi on the right rear corner instantly (<span class="tooltip">90-100 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">55-60 mph</span></span>).

    <TabItem value="strat2" label="350Z (Z33) vs. S2000">
Choose the 350Z. Win the first round by cutting the fourth corner on the track. In the second round, push the rear right of the S2000. It should lose control easily, allowing you to push them off the track for an easy outrun. Cut the second corner if needed.

    <TabItem value="strat3" label="Evolution IX vs. Evolution X">
Either car works. Evo IX is a bit faster, but I also find it marginally easier to crash out.

First round: Wait ~2s then go alongside your opponent. Stay on the outside in the first turn, then T-Bone your opponent in the rear half. Reset your car if needed and outrun them. You have to either flip their car or have them face towards the wall, otherwise they recover quickly and continue! Second round is the same, but you don't have to wait at the start, just make sure to stay behind.

	</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="strat4" label="RX-7 vs. Z4 M CoupÃ©">
Choose the Z4. Win both rounds by cutting the second corner across the grass straight into the wall. You can spin your opponent in the second round with a pit, but it's risky.
<div class="container-169">

</div>
	</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="strat5" label="WRX STI vs. Evolution IX">
Choose the Impreza. In the first round, wait ~2.5s then go after your opponent. Reach 130 km/h then pit them and cut the first corner for the outrun. The start timing is very tight, so alternatively you can start and cut across the track to have more control over the speed of your opponent. Your backup is pushing your opponent off in the first corner.

In the second round, start on full throttle and perform an instant pit on the Evo for a quick outrun. Cut the first corner if needed. They can recover quickly if the pit is done incorrectly!

    <TabItem value="strat6" label="Camaro SS vs. Challenger">
Choose the Camaro. Either wait ~2.5s at the start or go across the track and hug the wall. Get alongside your opponent and pit them while going <span class="tooltip">140-160 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">87-100 mph</span></span>. The Challenger is a very unstable car at speed, it is possible to destabilize it, spin it or even flip it. Once done you can outrun your opponent. As a backup you can push them out on the first corner. Second round is much the same. Get a good start to prevent them from going right, then repeat your preferred method.

<summary>Car Battle II strats</summary>
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="strat1" label="911 GT2 vs. GT-R SpecV">
Choose the GT-R. Start the first round with full throttle in first gear, make the left corner with at most a short lift then cut across the grass to outrun your opponent. Same start in the second round, but immediately pit the Porsche. If that fails, you might still be able to outrun them like in the first round.

	</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="strat2" label="Corvette Z06 vs. 911 GT3 RS">
Choose the Corvette. Perfect launch in the first round and maximize acceleration up to the hairpin then lift, pull the handbrake, steer left and go back on full throttle while steering left. This way you can just barely outrun your opponent by cutting across most of the hairpin. Stay behind the Porsche in the second round and build at least <span class="tooltip">130 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">80 mph</span></span>, then spin them off the track. Cut across the hairpin again for the outrun.

    <TabItem value="strat3" label="V8 Vantage vs. R8">
Choose the R8. Outrun your opponent in both rounds by cutting Maggots & Becketts on the right side. You could pit the Aston in the second round, but it is a bit risky.
	<div class="container-169">
<iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOEk7PvaAU4?si=9BlgEuDpymJM1_7g&amp;clip=UgkxK3lGH1aJvefvaC_1fqGZ8ohreApdWrKU&amp;clipt=ELy_iAIY_PeKAg" title="YouTube video player" loading="lazy" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>
	</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="strat4" label="M3 E92 vs. Cayman S">
Choose the M3. Wait ~2.5s before going after your opponent in the first round. Make sure to stay just barely behind in the middle of the track. Get alongside their left side and push their car out of the corner, most likely taking you with it. Slow down enough to reset and outrun them before they can recover. Cut across to the left side after the start in the second round and repeat.

    <TabItem value="strat1" label="LP640 vs. LP560-4">
Choose the MurciÃ©lago. Wait ~1.5s at the start in the first round then accelerate to at least <span class="tooltip">130 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">80 mph</span></span> before pushing your opponent off the track. Cut across the hairpin if needed. Wait a bit at the start in the second round too, switch over to the left side and repeat. The main alternative or backup is pushing your opponent off on the braking zone for the hairpin, then resetting your car for the outrun.
<div class="container-169">

    <TabItem value="strat2" label="CCX vs. Zonda R">

Wait ~2s at the start of the first round then accelerate alongside or just behind your opponent all the way to <span class="tooltip">220-250 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">136-155 mph</span></span> then tap or push the rear left of the CCX to destabilize it. Try your best to keep it going and if your advantage is building fast, cut across the slow left corner, otherwise get back on the track and keep going until the outrun is successful. Start in second gear and short shift to third in the second round, staying behind or alongside the other car and repeat the move from the first round. Your alternative and backup is crashing your opponent out at the slow corner.
