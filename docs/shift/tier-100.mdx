# Tier 100%

Routes for Tier 100% runs.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Tier 1

You have two options for cars. If you have access to game version 1.01 use the Nissan 350Z, otherwise use 1.02 and the Audi TT.

Alpental, Glendale Club, 135i, 350Z, S2000, 2000GT-R, *Stage 2 Engine, Tires & Nitrous*, Dakota National, London River, Autopolis Lakeside, Time Attacks

## Tier 2

Lotus Elise and Chevrolet Camaro SS are the fastest cars for races. You can use any Japanese car, since there are only time attacks. I suggest using the Audi RS 4 if you need a bigger car to spin opponents.

The fastest drift cars are not known currently, use whichever ones you prefer. Higher grip cars like the RX-8, 370Z and Silvia should be faster in terms of acceleration.

Select your Japanese car. Car Battle II, Mixed Event: Time Attacks at Glendale West, Dakota GP & London River, Japan Series: Time Attacks at Tokyo Club, Autopolis Lakeside & Ebisu West

Upgrades: *Timing required.* Stage 3 Engine and Tires should be worth it, but not sure about Works Conversions. All Body Kits have the same effect on Tier 1 and Tier 2 cars.

Swap cars if needed. Mixed Event, Drift Competition, Mixed Series, Regional Series
