# Tier Any%

Routes for Tier Any% runs.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Tier 1

You have two options for cars. If you have access to game version 1.01 use the Nissan 350Z, otherwise use 1.02 and the Audi TT. Install all available upgrades.

Dakota National, Autopolis Lakeside, 350Z, S2000, Alpental, Glendale Club

## Tier 2

You need at least 3 cars: Lotus Elise, any European drift car and any Japanese drift car. While there is probably a best or fastest car for drifts, preference plays too big of a role here. You need to find which cars work for you. My choices are: M3 E36 and 370Z.

This route can collect up to 51 stars, one more than required, which means it is possible to skip one.

You have to earn all optional stars in the first round of drift events and quit before the second round goes green.

5 Car Battle events. Currently Camaro SS vs Challenger is the slowest.

Mixed Event: Laguna Seca or Ambush Canyon - Not sure which one is faster.

Drift Series - Donington: Choose your European drift car.

All 4 Drift Competition events. Every Europe Series Drift.

Japan Series Drifts at Autopolis and Miyatomi. Choose your Japanese drift car when prompted.

## Tier 3

You need at least 2 cars: Lamborghini Murciélago Works and a Japanese drift car. I suggest choosing between the Works converted RX-7, RX-8, 370Z and Silvia. There is an opportunity to set up a Works Viper for the Japan vs USA events, which is the fastest drift car by far. It is possible to save time with it even with the car swap, but it's also difficult to use due to the excessive grip on the drift line.

This route can collect up to 102 stars, two more than required, which means it is possible to skip two. I suggest skipping the 6th star twice on drifts (4s or 1200 points).

Race Series II, III and the first race of IV. All 4 Car Battle II events. SL65 AMG and Corvette Z06 Races. Europe vs Japan Drift at Silverstone and Drift Series III. Japan vs USA Drift at Miyatomi and Drift Series II.

An alternative route (slower): Same start, SL65 AMG, Exige S and Corvette Z06 Races, same Europe vs Japan, then partial drifts at Miyatomi and Tokyo within Japan vs USA. I suggest skipping the 6th star on the Exige S Race.
