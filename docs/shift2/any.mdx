# Career Any%

Career Any% route for Shift 2: Unleashed 1.02 (DLCs required).

## Early game

Start Career mode and close the game as soon as the video starts playing. Open the game and enter career again. This skips the intro cutscene.

At the end of the tutorial lap, set your desired gameplay options. Gears are forcefully set to Auto here.

At the end of the tutorial race, set the difficulty to easy. Close the game as soon as the video starts playing and open the game again.

You can now set Gears to Manual and turn Automatic Clutch off.

Enter Quick and set: Drift Event Type, Miyatomi, 9 or 10 Laps. Change car to Speedhunters LFA and Play Now.

Perform a 9 lap long glitch drift worth at least 70k points by reversing into the outside wall. Control your speed with the steering angle. You have to stay above <span class="tooltip">30 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">19 mph</span></span>. Avoid going too fast, the car tries to straighten out above <span class="tooltip">55 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">34 mph</span></span>. I recommend an average speed of about <span class="tooltip">40 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">25 mph</span></span>.

## Works Championship

You have two options here: Use the Speedhunters Evo IX for all events as is, or tune the Speedhunters Huayra. The latter is significantly more difficult, as the Huayra is an RWD 1100+ HP monster with huge turbo lag. Nearly undrivable without Traction Control Low and Stability Control On. However, tuning the Huayra allows you to also tune your GT1 car later.

Huayra tune: Brake Pressure: 10-15 (optional), Final Drive: 8, 1st: 2, 2nd-3rd-4th: 4, 5th-6th-7th: 3. Front Sway Bar: 4 (preference).

Enter Works: Single Exhibitions and win all three events. Evo IX recommended for Riviera.

Win both series in Shanghai City Velocity Tour. Evo IX recommended.

Win the Works League Championship.

## FIA GT1 Championship

Buy a Maserati MC12 GT1. If you tuned the Huayra earlier, set max downforce on the MC12, otherwise use it as is.

Win all 4 events from GT1 Single Exhibitions, then win the Hockenheim Day & Night Tour.

Win the FIA-GT1 Championship to complete the run.
