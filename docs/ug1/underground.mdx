# Full Game Guide

Guide for Underground 100%.

## Before the run

It’s recommended to practice all the tracks by doing Individual Stage or Individual Level runs first.

Basic Tips: avoid hitting poles, signs, cars at all cost, sliding on walls. If you ever feel like you are going to crash try to brake and avoid the obstacle. It’s always better to slow down and avoid something or take a slightly different route instead of crashing out.

For every Circuit, Sprint and Drift you can view the IL records for the best routes to take. Keep in mind, these routes will have to be adjusted (such as wallrides, wallbumps, shortcuts, avoiding traffic, double tapping and double steering) based on how upgraded your car is, what car you currently have and on the level of traffic, so you might not always follow the same line as in the videos but you can review them so you have an idea of how to drive around each of the tracks. [Levels](https://www.speedrun.com/nfsu/levels) | [Individual Stages](https://www.speedrun.com/nfsu?h=Individual_Stages-Stage_1&x=9kvn143d-38dwrjzn.81pm8jk1)

Note: This is the 100% route, the any% route doesn’t include all the time-trials and has you customize your car a bit more and 2 times compared to once in the beginning in the 100% route.
