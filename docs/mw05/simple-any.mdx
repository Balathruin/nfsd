# Simple Career Any% guide

The best Any% route for new runners.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Before the run

Make sure you've [set your game up correctly](/mw05/setup), read [general information](/mw05/info) and the [category rules](https://www.speedrun.com/nfsmw05?h=Career_Any-Glitches&rules=category).

This page is a guide for the simple route, so please read all of it first. It reads in the same order as you perform the run and contains clips for each strat, which I highly recommend you watch. [Jump to the Summary for the route only.](#summary)

This route requires reduced World Level of Detail and the bonus cash from an Underground 2 savefile!

Autosave ON recommended. Create a copy or archive of your set up savefile for easier and faster resets. Make sure to not touch anything outside of options after creating a new alias.

I highly recommend restarting the game if you have entered career before your run. It is possible to invalidate your run by changing the default position of the menus in career.

Don't forget to restart your game if you've changed anything in the options.

Ensure that your Quick Race settings are reset to default. Use the Defaults button on the race options screen.

The run starts from the Main Menu when you first enter Quick Race.

## Prologue

#### Lap Glitch circuit 14, 1, 2, 3 as follows:

Quick Race, Custom Race, Circuit. Switch region left under the map to City. Select Century Square and change Laps to 1 and Traffic Level to None, then Accept. Back out twice to the race selection screen and switch region twice to College - either direction works. Select circuit 1 Ironwood estates, Accept and back out twice. Select circuit 2 Campus Way, Accept and back out twice. Select circuit 3 Highlands, Accept and back out into the main menu. Select Career and Start Career.

Important! If the game shows *Continue Career*, the run is not valid!

When you finish the circuit race, restart it and Quit to Career Main Menu, then Continue Career. This skips the cutscene where Razor challenges you to a race, saving about 32 seconds.

## Sonny

Choose the Volkswagen Golf GTI as your first car.

Start Race 1. Perfect start is between 3-4000 RPM with the stock Golf. At the end of the race, turn around and enter the tuning shop.

Install a spoiler and upgrade to Race Engine. You can open the cart with Start (Xbox), Options (PS) or 4 (keyboard) instead of backing out twice.

Start the chase from Bounty 2. Enter cooldown twice to increase the cop spawn rate.

You need all milestones: 2 Tags and Pursuit Time over 2 minutes but under 4 minutes. Earn at least 2950 bounty before you escape, which requires at least a triple combo and an extra kill (3+1) with an exactly 2 minute chase.

Race 3, Challenge the Boss

Do NOT boss skip and choose the second and third markers. Optimally you want the cash marker. Cash and pink slip allows you to buy the transmission upgrade on Baron.

## Taz

#### Without the cash marker:

Jump to Safe House, Car Select and sell Sonny's Golf. Resume Free Roam and enter the tuning shop on your right.

#### With the cash marker:

Enter the tuning shop you just spawned outside of.

#### Once you are in the tuning shop:

Upgrade to Race Transmission, Pro Suspension and Pro Nitrous. Tune +5 Ride Height, then complete Camera 4 Milestone (the first Photo Ticket, <span class="tooltip">150 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">93 mph</span></span>).

Start the chase from Bounty 2. Enter cooldown once to spawn a second cop quickly. You need all milestones: 1000 Bounty, 15000 Cost to State and 3 infractions. Generate at least 2000 CTS then destroy two cop cars in combo on a pursuit breaker and escape.

Optimally you want to use the radio tower at the police station, then escape towards Camera 5 <span class="tooltip">(145 km/h)<span class="tooltiptext">90 mph</span></span> as shown below. Be careful though, you can softlock the game if you trigger the camera immediately after the chase!

If you didn't generate enough bounty on Sonny, enter cooldown twice and destroy 3 cop cars in combo instead.

</details>

Jump to Safe House, back out to the main menu and Lap Glitch circuits 4 and 5 in any order. Resume Career and Free Roam.

If you haven't done it already, complete Camera 5 Milestone (the second Photo Ticket, <span class="tooltip">145 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">90 mph</span></span>).

Check your total bounty and subtract 50k from it. This is your overshoot. Subtract your overshoot from 18k to get your Izzy bounty target: 18000 – overshoot.

Complete Races 1, 4, 5 and 6, then Challenge the Boss.

Boss skip after the second race against Taz by clicking the right side of the continue button. About fifth of the button is boss skip, so no need to be precise.

Pick the performance (junkman) marker for suspension and the second or third bonus marker. Cash or pink slip allows you to buy the transmission upgrade on Baron.

## Izzy

Upgrade to Pro Tires and install the Junkman Suspension from the backroom.

Complete Camera 5 <span class="tooltip">(195 km/h)<span class="tooltiptext">121 mph</span></span>, then Lap Glitch circuit 6 and switch region left to All Regions. If you have Sonny's or Taz's car, sell one of them.

Start Race 2 from the Safe House and try to get cops during the race. Be careful at the bridge near the end as the cops slow down a lot.

If you have cops, turn around and trigger backup quickly. If you don't have cops, restart the race on the finish line, Jump to Safe House and start Race 7.

If you didn't get cops on either race, start a chase from Bounty 2. Wait until you reach heat 2 before triggering the backup because the timer is 1 minute shorter.

You need 2 Izzy milestones: 8 Tags and a chase over 4 minutes. Required bounty is your Izzy target or 18000.

Boss skip and skip markers by clicking the Choose Markers button.

## Baron

Upgrade to Pro Engine, Super Pro Suspension and Super Pro Nitrous. If you have more than 45000 cash, also upgrade to Pro Transmission.

Start the chase from Bounty 2. If you have at least 2 filled bars of heat, enter cooldown once. Double cooldown if 3 bars, or triple if 4 or more bars of heat.

Trigger the backup when you have 3 empty bars of heat towards heat 3 by destroying 8 cop cars (3+5 or 4+4). This way you reach the next heat level before the backup arrives.

Lap Glitch Lap Knockout (KO) 6 by setting Opponents to 1 and Traffic Level to None. Return to Free Roam.

Start Race 2, which has Baron Camera 7 <span class="tooltip">(225 km/h)<span class="tooltiptext">140 mph</span></span> after it if you turn left at the end of the road.

Complete Races 1, 5, 7 and 8 in any order, then Challenge the Boss.

The drag race against Baron can be quite difficult as there is little room for error. You need to nail the start and stay ahead of Baron. If he overtakes you, it's over unless he crashes out. You need to switch lanes to the right before the end of the split road, otherwise you are going to total on the water barrels!

If you have Race Transmission, you want to either skip perfect start or short shift into second gear to avoid overheating the engine. With Pro Transmission, you can perfect start using the rev drop method.

Boss skip and skip markers by clicking the Choose Markers button.

Beware of blind traffic at the last speedtrap! You can avoid them by going on the pavement on the left.

Lap Glitch KO 8 and start Race 4 from the Safe House. If no cops, start the chase from Bounty 2.

You need at least 3 Jewels milestones: 18 Tags, over 6 minutes and 5 Infractions. To complete infractions you need either Hit and Run or Speeding <span class="tooltip">(241 km/h)<span class="tooltiptext">150 mph</span></span>. Required bounty depends on your roadblock milestones:

| Milestones | Bounty |
| :--------: | :----: |
|    none    |  322k  |
|  4 blocks  |  287k  |
|  6 blocks  |  276k  |
| 4+6 blocks |  241k  |

You might still have the 2 roadblock milestone from Big Lou, which gives 30k bounty. Jewels has two additional cameras for 24k bounty each (48k total).

Jewels' drag is easier than Baron's, but you still need a good start to guarantee the win. However, this race has a broken traffic lua script which causes 3 vehicles on the side of the road to not move. In very rare cases the script does work, so be careful when driving past the stadium as the news van could total you with ease.

Due to the slight incline, it is more difficult to get a clean start. Be careful with Race Transmission, you can easily overheat your engine on the finish straight.

Boss skip and pick the junkman marker for transmission.

## Ming

Upgrade to Super Pro Engine, Super Pro Transmission, Ultimate Tires and install the Junkman Transmission.

Tune +1 Handling and +2 Nitrous, Lap Glitch KO 11, then start the chase from Bounty 2.

You need at least 3 Ming milestones: 22 Tags, over 7 minutes and 4 Spikes or 10 Roadblocks. You want additional bounty for JV. Recommended targets (more is better):

| Milestones | Bounty |
| :--------: | :----: |
|    none    |  850k  |
|  8 blocks  |  800k  |
| 10 blocks  |  750k  |

You might still have the 6 roadblock milestone from Earl, which gives 46k bounty. Ming has two additional cameras for 46k bounty each (92k total).

Complete Races 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Restart Race 7 on the finish screen if you get cops.

If you are missing bounty, Race 8 has Ming Camera 7 <span class="tooltip">(255 km/h)<span class="tooltiptext">158 mph</span></span> after it across the boardwalk for 46k, otherwise complete Webster Cameras for 60k each (180k total).

Challenge the Boss.

Skip perfect start on JV's drag like on Ming. JV can easily catch you in the second half if you are too slow. If you get a really good start, you can be too fast to pass under the truck on the right side, so I recommend keeping a bit of your nitro.

## Final Pursuit

#### Without the glitch:

Keep your speed up, avoid spikes and watch out for rhinos. Make your way to the Bus Station in Rosewood where you can go up the ramp on the right side to confuse the cops. Here you can wait in relative safety until about 4:20 when you want to start driving towards the other end of Rosewood. Do NOT drive past the western Donut shop before the timer hits 5:00, otherwise you are too close for Mia's call! Build up speed and make the jump over the bridge.

#### With the glitch:

Quit to Main Menu as soon as the UI appears and Continue Career - this gives the M3 ultimate nitro, making the Final Pursuit much easier.

Do NOT hit the pursuit breaker at the start and turn around by going under the wooden overpass. Turn left to the split road, drive past the beacon and turn right into the Docks. Once the timer hits 20s, roadblocks can spawn, usually next to the beacon or on the bridge. Avoid rhinos if you encounter them.

Turn left after driving past the jets and aim for the garage door at the left side exit. If you are using hood or bumper cam, I suggest using *Pull Camera Back* as you are approaching the garage, then hold *Look Behind* just before hitting the garage door. If you are using close or far camera, use speedbreaker instead of pull camera. You need the camera to go past the wall to despawn the collision. Make sure your car is angled slightly to the right. If the camera is on the other side of the door, drive into it, should let you past. After you are through, don't go too far, you need to head north and keep looking back to get outside of the garage. Stop looking back once you are out, but don't go right immediately or you end up back in bounds. Get under the road, turn left and follow it until the bridge, where you can drive through the first pillar on the right. Go to the intersection of the tunnel and cross it going east, drive past the bottom of the building on the right and turn 170° right. Avoid the intersections and cross the roads close to the middle, otherwise you'll hit invisible collisions. Line up in the middle of the parallel roads and aim for the chimney of the boat. If you did everything correctly, you'll start falling then hit an angled collision and after a few spins your car should be tilted with the correct angle. Drive up a bit, under the river, under Riverside Drive and Petersburg Interchange and aim for the bottom of the trees next to Hwy 99. Slow down slightly and turn left to get back in bounds. Be careful, if you flip your car here, you have to restart! Build up speed and go for the jump. Minimum speed required is <span class="tooltip">185 km/h<span class="tooltiptext">115 mph</span></span>. You'll lose speed when going on the bridge, which can be mitigated by activating speedbreaker.
