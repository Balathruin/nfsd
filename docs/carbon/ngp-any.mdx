### Setting up

Start by setting up the Save. Firstly make sure you have watched the tutorial cutscenes for drift and canyon gamemodes. The career one is unskippable so it doesn’t matter to watch this one and save the game once you have made sure these are watched. You can check these by loading these events in a quick race. If so Save the save file. Make sure you have the Dealership downtown (Kenji territory) saved as your most recent location. To do this go into the dealership then exit and save your game. Next we must set up the actual wrong warp. This can be done by selecting darius canyon in quick race and going to the menu where it showcases the race settings. By going to this screen it will save the race into the game memory where it can be stored and used later to do the actual wrong warp. If you do not have this race load it in a 100% save file which can be found [here](https://www.speedrun.com/nfsc/resources/qm8dy).

### Prologue

Load your NG+ ready savefile and start your career. Once the Cross sprint has been completed enter the career by pressing “start” on your controller on the Mazda RX-8. This car is used because it is the fastest car available for the run we are doing and has the fastest route to a race in free roam.

Now you must complete the tutorial as usual and get a good truck spawn to complete the chase fast. Hitting the rear of the truck is always ideal to get the pursuit breaker to activate without losing too much speed.

### The warp

Once in the safehouse the tutorial will play with Nikki explaining how territories work. This is not important. Once you have watched this it will lock you onto a race on the map. Back out of this and go to customise your car. Upgrade to Pro Engine with 333 tuning. Once out of the Performance section you can press the “start” button on your controller to go to the checkout menu to purchase your set upgrades. Now go back to the career menu and Save your save file and load it again. The reason this is done is to set your location to the dealership in downtown that was mentioned prior. This can only be loaded in a “new” career when the save file has been loaded and since we want to keep our engine upgrade and not watch the tutorial cutscenes again. We save the game then load it.

The drive left then continued south to the race blip on the map aka the star. Where you will press the up D-pad button to trigger the race or enter on keyboard. Once in this menu press your “change teammate” button and select Neville. If done correctly you will be loaded into the previously saved in memory race which is Darius canyon. Keep in mind that this race will be unloaded out of memory if you pull out the map.

### Darius

During Darius canyon you want to keep on him until the large left hander where he can sometimes rubber band and slow down quite a large margin allowing you to overtake him though it is quite rare and difficult to pull off. If you cannot do this you must do the 2nd stage of the Darius battle. To successfully win you must brake test Darius to gain 5k points upon any contact with him, By consistently brake testing him and having him hit the rear of your car you will be able to steadily keep points. This is tricky to do though as if he gets passed you will most likely not be able to overtake him again. Rear view mirror option in settings is recommended to know where he is at all times.
